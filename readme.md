# Backend Projects - Node.js, Express, EJS

Welcome to my collection of **backend projects** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS**. These projects showcase different aspects of backend development and serve as a practical way to demonstrate my understanding of dynamic web application creation.

## Projects Overview

- **QR Code Generator**  
  A simple tool that generates QR codes based on user input. This project demonstrates how to integrate external libraries and handle user data effectively.

- **Postman Middleware Testing**  
  A project focused on testing middleware functionality in Express using Postman. It includes various routes with middleware that handles authentication, logging, and data validation.

- **EJS Learning**  
  A learning project that integrates EJS templates for dynamic web pages. It showcases how to use EJS to render dynamic content on the server side.

- **Additional Projects**  
  Various small backend applications demonstrating different aspects of backend development such as database integration, routing, API development, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**  
- **Express**  
- **EJS**  
- **Postman** (for API testing)

## Installation

To get started with any of the projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>

cd <project-directory>

npm install

npm start

nodemon <file-name>.js

Just replace `<repo-url>` and `<project-directory>` with your actual repository URL and project directory name. You can now copy this directly for your GitHub `README.md`. Let me know if you need anything else!
